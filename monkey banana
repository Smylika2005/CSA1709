% Define the initial state
state(monkey(ground), banana(high), box(ground)).

% Action to move the box
move_box :- 
    state(monkey(ground), banana(high), box(ground)),
    retract(state(monkey(ground), banana(high), box(ground))),
    assert(state(monkey(ground), banana(high), box(near))).

% Action to climb the box
climb_box :- 
    state(monkey(ground), banana(high), box(near)),
    retract(state(monkey(ground), banana(high), box(near))),
    assert(state(monkey(climbing), banana(high), box(near))).

% Action to grab the banana
